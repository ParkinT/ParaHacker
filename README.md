Profesional Profile

I have been working on the Internet since 2002, when it was very young. Before that I had built electronic circuits from discrete parts and wrote software utilities in ASSEMBLY Language.
An insatiable "Hacker" spirit drives me incessantly to explore, study, dissect and learn new techniques and technologies.

A Technical Trainer, Author, Screencaster and Avid Logophile; when faced with a "Glass Half Empty" problem, I believe __The Glass was Over Designed__.

Currently responsible for the Rails API (back-end) of [Disciplr.com](https://disciplr.com) I previously spent a decade on a DoD contract for the US Air Force, with an Active Security Clearance, as [Automated Test Engineer] (https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/1465399)Automated Test Engineer and Technical Trainer.
